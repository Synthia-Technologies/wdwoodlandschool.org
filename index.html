                    The West Denmark Woodland School is a state-licensed, nature-based early childhood center focusing on nature play and offering full-day
                    programming for children ages 2.5 to 5 years. The Woodland School is founded on principles and practices of the Danish Forest School model (environmental/outdoor education)
                    and the Italian Reggio Emilia model (inquiry and expression documented through the arts and photography).

                    We are guided by the idea that children learn with enthusiasm and a sense of wonder when they spend ample time in nature.
                    Play, imagination, and choice are recognized as vital to children's learning and development. While fostering whole-child development and nature connections,
                    our Woodland School prepares young children to succeed in school and in life.

                    The curriculum assumes all learners can explore and make discoveries in nature and can develop positive relationships with each other and their environment. 
                    hildren are offered the opportunity to take supported risks appropriate to the environment and to themselves as learners.
                    The curriculum emphasizes basic forest ecology and natural sciences, motor awareness, use of inquiry tools for investigations and the arts to express learnings,
                    and healthy living as well as the beginnings of literacy awareness and mathematical reasoning.

                    We are located on ancestral lands of the Anishinaabe peoples or the Chippewa First Nation.
                    The Anishinaabe cared for Wisconsin's woodlands for thousands of years and regarded them as a gift from the Great Spirit.
                    The woodlands provided Chippewa families with food and materials for their homes, tools, ornaments, toys, and transportation as well as artistic and spiritual inspiration.
                    We are committed to acknowledging and honoring the history, culture, and current lives of the Anishinaabe peoples as we engage with and learn from nature.

                    The West Denmark Woodland School was founded by three passionate educators (Liz Dodge, Mary Jensen, and Carrie Petersen),
                    who recognized that rural families need quality early education programs and that forest school education is an incredibly powerful experience.
                    Our Woodland School's roots, however, reach deeper than this starting point, as we stand on the shoulders of our Anishinaabe ancestors and our more recent ancestors,
                    whose love of nature inspired them as foresters, builders, storytellers, woodworkers, artists, writers, singers, musicians, dancers, planters, and educators.

                    <summary>What is a Forest School?</summary>
                    A Forest School is an international approach to early learning that originated in Denmark in the 1950s and takes place primarily outdoors, exposing learners to all they can learn about the nature and the natural world.
                    With a renaissance of interest in outdoor learning in the United States about 20 years ago, the Forest School has grown to a popular, nation-wide approach in the early education.
                    Forest Schools emphasize the importance of play, exploration, supported risk-taking, and a strong connection with the natural environment.
                    In addition to these key principles, our Woodland School program emphasizes individual and group expression and documentation of learning through the arts.

                    The following clothing/supply requirements are for everyone attending a Woodland School session:<br><br>
                    <b>Winter:</b>
                        2 winter hats, Fleece neck warmer or balaclava, 2 pairs of warm, waterproof mitts, 1 warm, waterproof snowsuit, 1 set of warm, waterproof boots (preferably with a removable liner), 
                        3 base layers-thermal top/shirt and pants, middle layer, wool/fleece sweater, and 2 pairs of warm, wool socks.<br>
                    <b>Spring and Fall:</b>
                        See Summer list; plus a warmer sweater or jacket, long pants and long-sleeve top/shirt, gloves for cool weather, base layers, and extra boots (rain, hiking).<br>
                    <b>Summer:</b>
                        Rain gear (waterproof boots or wellies, waterproof over-pants, and waterproof jacket), hiking or running shoes, sun hat, lightweight clothing (but long pants and long-sleeve top/shirt), bug and tick spray, and sunscreen.<br>
                    <b>All Seasons:</b>
                        Small backpack (daypack), water bottle, sunglasses, change of clothes (especially socks!), and sleeping bag.<br><br>

                    There is no need to go with expensive gear - check out the local thrift shops for good quality things at fraction of the cost!
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Where is the West Denmark Woodland School Located?</summary>
                    The West Denmark Woodland School is located at 2478 170th Street, Luck, Wisconsin 54853. For directions from your location, please see Google Maps or MapQuest.
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>What if my Child Needs to Go to the Bathroom While in the Woods?</summary>
                    The Woodland School follows Leave No Trace (LNT) principles as best as possible when students need to use the washroom away from our main facilities. Children will use a foldable OXO Tot Potty with liners. Staff are prepared with hand washing kits (i.e., pump thermos with hot water and a soap dispenser and other material needed to do this successfully).
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>What about Extreme Weather Days?</summary>
                    Whether we have rain, sun, wind, or snow, we can learn outdoors.
                    When children are dressed appropriately, they are able to become deeply engaged in play and are not bothered by the "bad" weather.
                    Weather creates an opportunity to learn about the ever-changing seasons and the impacts they have on our landscapes.
                    Children learn to embrace and to find joy in every type of weather that western Wisconsin brings.<br><br>

                    That said, we take precautions and stay indoors when weather conditions call for it. We follow the guidelines of the Wisconsin Child Care Weather Watch Chart, taking into account both the wind-chill factor and relative humidity as well as temperature and storm conditions.
